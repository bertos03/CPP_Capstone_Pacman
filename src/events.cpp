/*
 * PROJECT COMMENT (events.cpp)
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * This file is part of "BobMan", an SDL2 game inspired by Pac-Man.
 * The code in this unit has a clear responsibility so newcomers can quickly
 * understand the architecture: data model (map, elements), runtime logic
 * (game, events), rendering (renderer), and optional audio output.
 *
 * Important notes for newcomers:
 * - Header files declare classes, methods, and data types.
 * - CPP files contain the concrete implementation of the logic.
 * - Multiple threads move game entities in parallel, so shared data is read
 *   and written in a controlled way.
 * - Macros in definitions.h control resource paths, colors, and features.
